Project Nexus
Overview

Project Nexus is a comprehensive documentation hub capturing major learnings from the ProDev Backend Engineering Program. It showcases understanding of backend engineering concepts, tools, and best practices, serving as a reference for both current and future development projects.

Key Technologies Covered

Programming Languages: Python

Frameworks: Django, Django REST Framework

APIs: REST APIs, GraphQL

Containerization & Deployment: Docker, CI/CD pipelines

Important Backend Development Concepts

Database Design: Relational databases, normalization, indexing, and query optimization

Asynchronous Programming: Async views, background tasks, and event-driven programming

Caching Strategies: Redis caching, query caching, and HTTP caching mechanisms

Challenges Faced and Solutions Implemented

Challenge: Managing complex API authentication

Solution: Implemented JWT authentication with refresh tokens for secure, stateless sessions

Challenge: Optimizing slow database queries

Solution: Added proper indexing, used select_related/prefetch_related in Django ORM, and implemented caching

Challenge: Dockerizing the backend for smooth deployment

Solution: Created Dockerfiles and docker-compose configuration for local development and production

Best Practices and Personal Takeaways

Always structure code modularly to separate concerns

Use environment variables for sensitive configurations

Write comprehensive tests to ensure code reliability

Document endpoints and system architecture for team collaboration

Collaborate closely with frontend developers to ensure seamless API integration

Collaboration – Key to Success
